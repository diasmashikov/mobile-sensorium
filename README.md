# Mobile Sensorium

## Introduction
Welcome to Mobile Sensorium, an innovative Flutter application designed to harness the power of mobile sensors. Utilizing the sensors plus package, this app collects data from an array of sensors including the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. Our goal is to explore and implement machine learning techniques to transform this sensory data into meaningful and useful insights.

## Features
- **Sensor Data Collection:** Leverage the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to gather real-time motion and environmental data.
- **Showing the orientation state of the mobile device**
- **Integration of sqflite local database to collect and utilize stored sensor data overtime for data analysis and ML usage
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Innovative methods for applying machine learning algorithms to sensor data.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A sleek and intuitive user interface, crafted using Flutter, for easy interaction and data visualization.

## Getting Started
To get started with Mobile Sensorium, follow these simple steps:
1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/вшфыьфыршлщм/ьobile-sensorium.git`
2. **Install Dependencies:** Run `flutter pub get` in the project directory.
