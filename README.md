# Mobile Sensorium

## Introduction
Welcome to Mobile Sensorium, an innovative Flutter application designed to harness the power of mobile sensors. Utilizing the sensors plus package, this app collects data from an array of sensors including the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. Our goal is to explore and implement machine learning techniques to transform this sensory data into meaningful and useful insights.

## Features
- **Sensor Data Collection:** Leverage the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to gather real-time motion and environmental data.
- **Showing the orientation state of the mobile device**
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Innovative methods for applying machine learning algorithms to sensor data.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A sleek and intuitive user interface, crafted using Flutter, for easy interaction and data visualization.

## Getting Started
